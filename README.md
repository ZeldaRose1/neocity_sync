# neocity_sync
This repository contains a script that I wrote to automate syncing a folder on my home tower to Neocities.
I wanted to be able to edit things without using the UI and wanted to avoid paying for the extra
subscription so this is how I'm going to do it.

As of the first upload, there is only one file in the repository "upload_files.py", but this may grow
as I need more functions or get better at web-dev.
